She bought Dior with her man from the store
But she bring it to my table when the drink start pourin' (Sheesh)
She askin' to come with the crew (Ask, "Who?")
And the accent, it come with a view (That's true)
She dancin' (She dancin'), unruly (Unruly)

[Verse 1]
Why you waitin' in the line by the door? (Line by the door)
You with your bestfriend, shit movin' slow (Shit's so slow)
Babygirl, thought I told you before (Told you before)
Anywhere that we be, you can go (You can go)
So bring your friеnds to the front
And when you're hеre, let me know (Let me know)
I'm a nice guy (A nice guy), for sure (Yeah, for sure)
No, for real (No, for real), lemme show you (Ayy)
You wanna move through the crowd now (Crowd now, move now)
You lookin' good, turn around now (Girl, turn around now)
You put that on just for me, babe? (Oh my days)
She told me, "Boy, settle down now" (Damn)

Now, go, baby, go (Go, baby, go), to the floor (To the floor)
Make it clap like a Broadway show, I might throw a rose (Throw a rose, oh my God), make a toast
Say the word, I'ma give you the world (Yeah)

You really wanna know, this kind of life never borin' (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
